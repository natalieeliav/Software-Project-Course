implementation of a clustering algorithm that is based on symmetric Non-negative
Matrix Factorization (symNMF).

contains the following files:
1. symnmf.py: Python interface of the code.
2. symnmf.h: C header file.
3. symnmf.c: C interface of the code.
4. symnmfmodule.c: Python C API wrapper.
5. analysis.py: Analyze of the algorithm.
6. setup.py: The setup file.
7. Makefile: script to build the C interface.

The project was done as part of the course "software project" in Tel Aviv university.
